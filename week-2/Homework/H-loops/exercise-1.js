/*
  While Loops
  ---------------------------------
Exercise 1:

  Write a while loop that prints "eating 1 slice of pizza" 6 times to the console.

  Use the variables slices and hungry to create a condition.
  If hungry is greater than slices, then we will eat a slice of pizza. 
  If hungry is the same as slices then the loop terminates.

  Don't forget to increase (slices ++) inside the while loop.

  let slices = 0;
  const hungry = 6;
  
  // add your code here, start with: while(...) {...}


  
     /* 
    EXPECTED RESULT
    ---------------
    eating 1 slice of pizza
    eating 1 slice of pizza
    eating 1 slice of pizza
    eating 1 slice of pizza
    eating 1 slice of pizza
